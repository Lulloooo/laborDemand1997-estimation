# laborDemand1997-estimation
This project was the first time I used R for my analysis. It is part of an University project (passed with Honors 🎉) that aims to estimate the labor demand by data from different firms in the year 1997 through different methods. 
More in details, I employed OLS and IV models at the beggining and a Panel Data approach (pooled OLS model along with a fixed-effects model) in the second part of the model.
❗️Detailed analysis' results and discussion can be found in the 1997-Labor-Demand-Estimation.pdf file.
This project contains 2 files and 2 folder (ReadMe.md excluded):

1️⃣ a .pdf file that contains the analysis and the estimation procedure and results
2️⃣ a .R file that contains the code of the estimation
3️⃣ in_data folder that contains the df that has been analyzed
4️⃣ out_data folder that contains the output (plots) from the .R file.
